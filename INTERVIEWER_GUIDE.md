- Modern browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

### 1. Test the Application Yourself

Before administering the challenge, you should:
- Complete all challenges to understand the candidate experience

cd React-Developer-Challenge
npm install

# Verify everything works
npm start
npm test
```

### 3. Create Candidate Materials

**Important**: Create a clean version for candidates:

1. **Remove the solutions file**:
```bash
# Option 1: Delete SOLUTIONS.md before sharing
rm SOLUTIONS.md

# Option 2: Add to .gitignore and create a candidate branch
echo "SOLUTIONS.md" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Hide solutions from candidates"
git checkout -b candidate-version
git push origin candidate-version
```

2. **Remove this interviewer guide**:
```bash
rm INTERVIEWER_GUIDE.md

|---------------|-------|-------|------------|
| 28/28 | 100% | Expert 🏆 | Outstanding React knowledge, ready for senior+ roles |
| 22-27 | 80-99% | Senior ⭐ | Strong React skills, suitable for senior positions |
| 17-21 | 60-79% | Mid-Senior ✨ | Good knowledge, suitable for mid-senior roles |
| 11-16 | 40-59% | Mid 📚 | Decent foundation, needs more experience |
| <11 | <40% | Junior 🌱 | Basic knowledge, suitable for junior roles |

### ⏱️ Time-based Scoring (Secondary Metric)

Time completion provides additional context:

| Time | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| <45 min | Outstanding ⚡ | Exceptional speed and knowledge |
| 45-60 min | Excellent ✅ | On target, good problem-solving |
| 60-90 min | Good 👍 | Acceptable, thorough approach |
| 90-120 min | Satisfactory 📝 | Slower pace, may need support |
| >120 min | Needs improvement 📖 | Consider lower-level position |

### 💎 Code Quality Factors (Bonus Points)

Look for these in the candidate's solutions:

- ✅ **Clean, readable fixes**: Well-structured, easy to understand

- ✅ **Performance considerations**: Thinks about optimization
- ✅ **Error handling**: Considers edge cases

### 🎯 Recommended Scoring Formula

```
Final Score = (Flags Captured / 28) × 70% + (Time Score) × 20% + (Code Quality) × 10%

Time Score:
- <45 min: 100%
- 45-60 min: 90%
- 60-90 min: 70%
- 90-120 min: 50%
- >120 min: 30%

Code Quality Score:
- All factors met: 100%
- Most factors met: 70%
- Some factors met: 50%
- Few factors met: 30%

   - Clean installation ready
   - Browser with DevTools
   - Text editor/IDE set up
   - Timer ready

2. **Share candidate version**:
   - Send GitHub link (candidate branch)
   - Or provide pre-installed setup
   - Ensure SOLUTIONS.md is removed

3. **Set expectations**:
   - 45-minute target time
   - Open book (can use documentation)
   - Use of DevTools and debugging tools encouraged

2. **Observe their approach**:
   - Problem-solving methodology
   - Use of debugging tools
   - Code organization
   - Testing practices
3. **Take notes** on:
   - Which levels they complete
   - Where they struggle
   - How they debug issues
   - Questions they ask

### After the Interview

1. **Review their code**:
   - Check captured flags in the UI

## 🔒 Security & Integrity

### Protecting the Challenge

1. **Keep SOLUTIONS.md private**: Never share with candidates
2. **Monitor for cheating**: Watch for copied solutions
3. **Update regularly**: Change flags periodically if reusing
4. **Use private repository**: For your interviewer version

### Detecting Cheating

Watch for:
- Suspiciously fast completion (<20 minutes)
- Perfect solutions without debugging
- Copy-pasted code from online sources
- Knowledge of flags without solving challenges

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Adjusting Difficulty

You can customize the challenge by:

1. **Changing time limits**: Edit the target time in instructions
2. **Adding challenges**: Follow the pattern in existing levels
3. **Modifying flags**: Update `flagService.js`
4. **Adjusting hints**: Edit challenge files and `challengeHints.js`

### Creating New Challenges

1. Add new challenge file in appropriate level folder
2. Update tests for the new challenge
3. Add flag to `flagService.js`
4. Update documentation
